For each email, construct prompts for zero-shot, one-shot (with one labeled example), and few-shot (with 3-5 labeled examples) classification. Use the `classify_email_priority` function on the actual email text to predict its priority for each prompting method. Store the original email, its actual priority, and the predicted priority. Print the email, the formatted prompt, and the predicted priority neatly for each step. Finally, evaluate the consistency (accuracy) of each prompting method by comparing predicted with actual priorities, and discuss which technique *would theoretically* yield the most reliable results for a real Large Language Model (LLM) and why, while also noting how the keyword-based simulation behaves differently.

Create 6 sample student queries, each mapped to one of the four departments. Define a Python function `classify_query_department(query_text)` that uses simple if-else keyword matching to classify a query string into its respective department. For each sample query, construct zero-shot, one-shot (with one labeled example), and few-shot (with 3-5 labeled examples) prompts. Use the `classify_query_department` function on the *actual query text* to predict its department for each prompting method. Store the original query, its actual department, and the predicted department. Print the query, the formatted prompt, and the predicted department neatly for each step. Finally, evaluate the consistency (accuracy) of each prompting method by comparing predicted with actual departments, discuss how contextual examples *theoretically* affect classification accuracy for a real Large Language Model (LLM) and explain why, while also noting how the keyword-based simulation behaves differently, and summarize the experiment's outcomes and key observations."
